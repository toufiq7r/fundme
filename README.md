<h4>Project Title:</h4>
<h4>FundMe – A Digital Fundraising Solution</h4>
<h4>Project Description:</h4>

<h4 align="center">FundMe – Ass Digital Fundraising Solution</h4>
<h4>Itroduction:</h4>
FundMe is a non-profit crowdfunding platform that allows people to raise fund for events ranging from life events such as celebrations and graduations to challenging circumstances like accidents and illnesses.<br>
During this process, campaigners can describe their fundraising cause and the amount they hope to raise, and upload photos and videos.<br>
<br>
<h4>Process:</h4>
First, campaigner must register through starting a FundMe campaign. Then, they will be prompted to register for campaign proposal. After, successfully proposing their campaign they will need to wait for the approval form the admin. If approved doners will be able to donate through available campaigns panel. Doner can choose the campaigns they want to donate to. Lastly, if campaigners need to host another FundMe campaign someday, they can just login with their previously created account and propose for new campaign.<br>
Donors do not get any specified account from the system. They can just choose their preferred campaign and donate directly which saves time and reduces complexity. They can also choose to donate anonymously which will not share doners information with the campaigner.<br>
